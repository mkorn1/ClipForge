# Product Requirements Document: ClipForge
## Video Import and Preview Feature

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024  
**Status:** In Development  
**Product:** ClipForge - Fast Video Editor

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview
ClipForge is a lightweight, high-performance video editing application built with Tauri and Svelte, designed for speed and efficiency. The initial release focuses on core video editing workflows: importing, previewing, arranging, recording, and exporting.

### 1.2 Phase 1 Scope
This PRD covers **Phase 1**: Video Import and Preview functionality. Users will be able to import video files into the application and preview them before arranging clips on the timeline.

### 1.3 Product Vision
ClipForge aims to be the fastest, simplest video editor for users who need:
- Quick screen recordings
- Simple clip arrangement
- Fast exports without bloat

---

## 2. Product Context

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Existing video editors are either too complex (Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve) or too limited (basic mobile apps). There's a gap for a desktop application that offers:
- Native performance (Tauri backend)
- Simple, fast interface (Svelte frontend)
- Core editing features without overwhelming complexity
- Quick workflow for recording and editing screen content

### 2.2 Target Users
**Primary:** Content creators, developers, and educators who need to:
- Record and edit screen demonstrations
- Create quick tutorials and walkthroughs
- Edit simple video projects without heavy software
- Work with good performance on modest hardware

**Secondary:** Casual users looking for an alternative to complex video editing suites.

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Performance
- Lazy load thumbnails (generate on-demand)
- Use video frame extraction for thumbnails
- Don't block UI during import
- Efficient video playback (use native players where possible)

### 6.2 Error Handling
- Graceful failure for unsupported formats
- Clear error messages
- Suggest alternatives for failed imports
- Log errors for debugging

### 6.3 Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus indicators on interactive elements

### 6.4 Responsive Design
- Window resizing handled gracefully
- Minimum window size constraints
- Preview panel adapts to available space

---

## 7. Success Metrics

### 7.1 Phase 1 Metrics
- Import success rate > 95%
- Preview starts in < 2 seconds after click
- Video playback at native frame rate
- No crashes during import or ContentPreview
- File handling for files up to 10GB works reliably

### 7.2 User Experience Metrics
- User can import and preview within 30 seconds of opening app
- Clear feedback at each step
- Intuitive interface (minimal need for instructions)

---

## 8. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Phase 1)

## 9. Open Questions / Assumptions

### 9.1 Assumptions
- Users have video files already recorded
- Files are in common formats
- Tauri file dialog provides necessary functionality
- Video playback can use web technologies (HTML5 video or native)

### 9.2 Open Questions
- Where to store import metadata (Tauri store, local database, JSON file)?
- Should we copy imported videos or keep references?
- Do we need backend video processing (ffmpeg) for preview?
- Keyboard shortcuts priority and scope?

---

## 10. Dependencies

### 10.1 Tauri APIs
- `@tauri-apps/api` for file operations
- File picker dialog
- File system access
- Possibly shell commands for video processing

### 10.2 Frontend Libraries (Potential)
